# Monopoly lottery simulation

Ever wanted to add your own rules to monopoly?

In a recent game, my friend introduced some house rules - monopoly lottery. The idea is simple. When you pass go, you can buy a lottery ticket for $50. If you land on free parking, you win the lottery, and net $500. Is it worth it?
