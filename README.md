# Monopoly lottery simulation

Ever wanted to add your own rules to monopoly?

In a recent game, my friend introduced some house rules - monopoly lottery. The idea is simple. When you pass go, you can buy a lottery ticket for $50. If you land on free parking, you win the lottery, and net $500. Is it worth it?

Let's [find out](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=brycecovert&repo=monopoly-lottery&path=monopoly.cljw). You can either [view the solution here](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=brycecovert&repo=monopoly-lottery&path=monopoly.cljw), thanks to gorilla repl, or clone and try yourself.
